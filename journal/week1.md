# Homework challenges

### Tag and push docker images to dockerhub
```
docker tag aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023-frontend-react-js keenson/cruddur-frontend:1.0

docker push keenson/cruddur-frontend:1.0


docker tag aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023-backend-flask keenson/cruddur-backend:1.0

docker push keenson/cruddur-backend:1.0
```



- Building the docker images locally for backend
  - clone the github repo to my local machine
  - create a virtual environment and build image from the dockerfile
    > docker build -t backend-flask .  
    > docker run --rm -p 4567:4567 -it -e FRONTEND_URL='*' -e BACKEND_URL='*' backend-flask

- I was also able to run the application on my local machine outside of gitpod/codespaces
  Here are images of the test of the app workin on my machine:
